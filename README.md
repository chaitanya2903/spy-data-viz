# CS526 DIVA Project SPYing on Option Values


This project looks at historical options performance of the SPY Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), which seeks to track the Standard and Poorâ€™s (S&P) 500 index. The S&P 500 is a collection of 500 large and mid
cap stocks traded on the NYSE. This ETF was chosen because it represents a large portion of the US market, and is one of the most heavily traded indexes on the market. The goal for
this project was to identify relationships between option Greek values and option performance over various time frames, as well providing users with tools to easily filter and visualize
data for their own research.
